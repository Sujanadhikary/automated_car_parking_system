# Automated Car Parking System with Arduino Uno

## Overview
This project showcases an automated car parking system using Arduino Uno, featuring 2 IR sensors for vehicle detection, a display showing available slots, and indicators for parking status.

## Hardware Requirements
- Arduino Uno
- 2 IR sensors
- Display (e.g., LED matrix or LCD)
- Green and red indicator lights
- Buzzer

## Installation and Setup
1. Connect the hardware components based on the circuit diagram.
2. Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.
3. Power up the system and ensure all components are operational.

## Code Explanation
```cpp
// Insert your code here with comments explaining key sections
```

## Functionality
The automated car parking system operates as follows:

1. **Vehicle Detection**: Two IR sensors are used to detect incoming and outgoing vehicles.
2. **Display**: The system displays the number of available parking slots.
3. **Parking Status Indicators**: A green light indicates an empty parking space.
4. **Full Parking Alert**: When all slots are occupied, the light turns red, and a buzzer sounds if a car attempts to enter.

This functionality ensures efficient parking management and enhances user experience.

## Limitations
- The system supports a maximum of 5 parking slots.
- Future improvements could include expanding parking capacity and code optimization.
